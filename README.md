# HTS - Mission: Basic 6 - Decryption Tool
After figuring out what the decryption method was, I decided to write a tool as a personal challenge.

Finding the encryption method (in this instance) is fairly simple; play around, notice patterns and see what sense you can make of the output in comparison to the input. Take regular or 'easy' strings like: 11111, 12345, aaaaa or abcde, using these can show simple pattern modification as they are a more recognisable sequence to spot change in. Simple stuff really! Fiddle, ~~play~~ debug and learn.

To see the decryption method and explanation, please see the commented source code. I have not placed it here for the sake of possible Google'rs stumbling across this. Spoilers!
