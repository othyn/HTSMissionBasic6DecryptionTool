# HTS - Mission: Basic 6 - Decryption Tool
After figuring out what the decryption method was, I decided to write a tool as a personal challenge.

The method for finding the encryption method is fairly simple; play around, notice patterns and see what sense you can make of the output in comparison to the input. Take regular or 'easy' strings like: 11111, 12345, aaaaa or abcde and see how the encryption method modifies the inputted string to give you the desired output, simple really!

To see the decryption method and explanation, please see the commented source code. I have not placed it here for the sake of possible Google'rs stumbling across this. Spoilers!
