# HTS - Mission: Basic 6 - Decryption Tool
After figuring out what the decryption method was, I decided to write a tool as a personal challenge.

The method for finding the encryption method is fairly simple; play around, notice patterns and see what sense you can make of the output in comparison to the input. Take regular or 'easy' strings like: 11111, 12345, aaaaa or abcde and see how the encryption method modifies the inputted string to give you the desired output, simple really!
